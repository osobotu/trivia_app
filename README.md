## Architecture

The project is build using Clean Architecture as described by Uncle Bob. The image below gives a high level overview of the structure used üëáüèæ

The project consists of three distinct layers. The Presentation layer, Domain layer and Data layer. Let's start from the layer farthest from our UI.

### Data Layer

This layer consists of three main components - `Datasources`, `Models` and `Repositories`. The ` datasources` communicate with external data providers such as an API, a database or a device feature (e.g. battery, location). It receives raw data in the form of JSON, xml or binary and converts them `models`. `Models` are basically pure dart objects. `Repositories` allow interaction between the Domain layer and Data layer.

### Domain Layer

This layer consists of `Repositories`, `Entities` and `Usecases`.

### Presentation Layer

This layer consists of `PresentationLogicHolders` and `Widgets`. `PresentationLogicHolder` is basically what you use for state management.
